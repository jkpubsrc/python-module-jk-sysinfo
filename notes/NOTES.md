On Raspberry Pi computers the commands "lshw", "sensors" and "needrestart" do not exist by default. However it can be installed via apt. After installing lshw parsing the output failed as lshw has a bug and does not output valid JSON.

On Ubuntu computers the commands "sensors" and "needrestart" do not exist by default. However it can be installed via apt.
